# regime-adaptability

### Project Title
Evaluating Machine Learning Adaptability Under Market Regime Shifts

### Research Question
How do machine learning models degrade and recover after market regime shifts, and which adaptation strategies improve recovery dynamics?

### Gap
Current research focuses on prediction accuracy and regime detection, but lacks standardized measurement of post-shift performance recovery.

### Method Summary
This project evaluates static and regime-aware models using recovery metrics such as performance drop magnitude and recovery time.
